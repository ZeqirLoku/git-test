              <ol>
                  <li> Take the juice from one ottle of O1 ' Janx Spirit.</li>
                  <li>Pour into it measure of water from the seas of Santraiginus V - Oh, that Santraginean seawater! Oh those Santraginean fish!</li>
                  <li>Allow three cubes of Artucan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture(it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).</li>
                  <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of
                  dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</li>
                  <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the
                    dark Qualactin Zones, subtitle, sweet and mystic.</li>
                  <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.</li>
                  <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor</li>
                  <li>Add an olive</li>
